# LANS Backend Sub Module

LANS (Language Agnostic News Summarizer) is a Flask application that leverages various natural language processing techniques to provide text summarization and similarity analysis for news articles. It includes the following functionalities:

- **Text Summarization**: LANS supports extractive text summarization, which involves scoring and extracting the most relevant sentences from the input text. It also incorporates abstractive summarization, aiming to generate summaries that understand the context.

- **Translation**: LANS provides translation capabilities to support different source languages. It includes translation from French to English and English to French, allowing users to input news articles in their preferred language.

- **Similarity Analysis**: LANS computes the similarity between the input article's headline and the generated summary. It utilizes sentence embeddings and cosine similarity to determine the degree of semantic similarity.

## Getting Started

To run the LANS application locally, follow the steps below:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure that the necessary models and configuration files are available in the specified paths.

3. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Usage

### Endpoint: `/predict` (POST)

This endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the following parameters:

- `source_lang` (string): The source language of the input text (e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French).
- `text` (string): The news article text to be summarized.
- `heading` (string): The headline of the news article.

Example usage:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "source_lang": "en",
    "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
    "heading": "Lorem ipsum"
}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the following fields:

- `translated_heading`: The translated and summarized version of the input heading.
- `source_translated_heading`: The translated and summarized heading in the source language.
- `similarity_score`: The similarity score between the input heading and the translated summarized heading.

## Evaluation and Bias Analysis

The LANS application also includes functionality for evaluating bias scores and conducting bias analysis. The code for this analysis can be found in the `evaluate.py`, `similarity.py`, and `summarize.py` files.

To evaluate bias scores, run the following command:
```
python evaluate.py
```

The resulting bias scores will be stored in the `./results/bias-results.json` file.

## Dataset

The LANS application uses a dataset of news articles for evaluation purposes. The dataset is stored in the `./data/fr_covid_news_8k.csv` file.
